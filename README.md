# Integrated-Development-Tools
Integrated Development Tools is a suite of tools that include: An extension to Visual Studio Code that tracks changes that are made to files, whether they are edited, deleted, and created. Also includes a code search tool that works with the visual studio code extension that allows users to view different git commits from different users, as well as filtering through different commits based on date/time, author, commit hash, repository, and branch. Data that is stored on the code search tool is stored on PostgresSQL and AWS.
